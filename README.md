## Planning Story
From Day-1 start choosing the idea and decide the name, design the ERD, user stories, wireframes and create the Apps, Repos. Continue by creating one Model/Controller in the back-end and check it with the Postman then go and design the related components in the front-end. For each 2 days there is a complete feature in the front-end with design and styles and the back-end functionality.

## Important Notes About FaveOne
 

-  Sharing the resources with the world means that you are agreeing to let other users contribute with you (reading, editing, adding, and for Admins they can delete the whole resource or some parts of it).

- The base idea of FavOne website is to let the people share the resources that they're like, and give the permissions to any registered user/admin to edit other registered user's resources.

- We allow the registered users only to own the Movies/Dramas so that they're be able to add/edit what they added,  and for deletion process is allowed only for users with Admin Role

- The resources(Actors/Genders/Episodes/ImageGalleries) ownership is for all registered users.

- The users/Visitors can search for Movies or Dramas by Title, and search for Actors or Movie-Drama's Catagory by Name.
